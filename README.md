Mall Customers Data Cleaning Project HR Elevate Labs – Data Analyst Internship Task

Project Purpose & Background

This project focuses on cleaning and preprocessing the Mall Customers dataset to transform raw data into a clean, structured format ready for insightful analysis and visualization. High-quality, clean data enables businesses to better understand customer demographics and behaviors, leading to smarter targeting and improved decision-making.

Project Overview

As part of my Data Analyst internship at HR Elevate Labs, this task involved preparing the dataset for advanced analytical tasks such as customer segmentation and clustering, which are crucial for marketing strategies and customer relationship management.

Tools & Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for exploratory data visualization
- Jupyter Notebook for interactive coding
- Dataset: Mall Customer Segmentation Data.csv (from Kaggle)

Repository Contents

- mall~~ customers~~ cleaning.ipynb — Complete data cleaning workflow
- Mall~~ Customers.csv — Original raw dataset
- cleaned~~ mall~~ customers.csv — Final cleaned dataset
- README.md— Project documentation and summary

Data Cleaning Process Overview



|Step|Description|
| - | - |
|Missing Values|Checked using .isnull(), handled appropriately|
|Duplicate Entries|Identified and removed duplicates using .drop~~ duplicates()|
|Column Renaming|Standardized column names to lowercase with un- derscores|
|Data Types|Verified and corrected data types (e.g., int, object)|
|Value Formatting|Cleaned and standardized categorical data values|
|EDA Preparation|Cleaned dataset made ready for clustering and visu- alization|

Outcomes & Key Learnings

- Gained practical experience in data preprocessing with Pandas
- Developed skills to efficiently handle missing values, duplicates, and formatting
- Prepared data that enhances the quality of downstream analysis and modeling
- Understood the critical role of data cleaning in generating reliable business insights
